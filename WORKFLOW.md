# Build workflow — how to execute TODO.md

This file is the **process manual** for working through `TODO.md` P0→P4 in one
continuous iterative session: build a task, review it, test it, commit it,
move to the next. `TODO.md` (+ the docs it cites) still owns *what* to build
and *why* — this file only owns *how to work* and the standing rules that
apply to every single task, so they don't need to be re-stated per task.

**Read this file in full before starting. Re-read it if your context gets
summarized/compacted mid-run — it's your memory of the rules, and `TODO.md`'s
checkboxes are your memory of progress.**

## 0. Non-negotiables

- **ToS risk.** Automating this game violates its terms of service (see
  README.md's warning). Never run a script that could DISPATCH, SEND, share,
  or otherwise mutate state against a **real, non-throwaway** account. The
  read-only inspection tools (`scripts/probe_*.py`,
  `scripts/inspect_live_playwright.py`) are for a throwaway account only.
- **Verify, don't guess — in this order:**
  1. The repo's own docs first: `docs/live-data-model.md`,
     `docs/lssm-requirement-mapping.md`, `docs/MODES-TODO.md`,
     `data/reference/api-endpoints.md`, `data/reference/*.json`. These already
     encode a lot of hard-won live verification — read the relevant one fully
     before writing code against an assumption.
  2. If still uncertain and it's a live-game behavior question, use the
     read-only probes. They need `BLAULICHT_EMAIL` / `BLAULICHT_PASSWORD` env
     vars for a throwaway account. Check for them first.
  3. If (1) and (2) both dead-end — no doc covers it, no probe can confirm it,
     no credentials available — **stop that specific task**, log it under
     "Blocked — needs Sasha" below (don't just skip silently), and move on to
     the next task. Don't ship a guessed field name or assumed game-setting
     state as if it were verified. Cite which doc or probe output confirmed
     anything you mark as confirmed.
- **Architecture.** `app/domain/` stays dependency-free — no `httpx`/framework
  imports; it's what makes the test suite run in ~0.1s. Network I/O only in
  `app/game/`. Dispatch is one vehicle per POST, deliberately (a live-capture-
  confirmed shape) — don't "optimize" it into a combined POST without a new
  capture proving it works.
- **Git.** Commit each finished task separately with a clear message — don't
  batch multiple TODO items into one commit. Do **not** push or merge to main
  without asking Sasha first.

## 1. The loop (repeat per task)

1. **Pick the next task.** Work `TODO.md` top to bottom: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 →
   P4, in the order items appear. Skip anything already checked `[x]` or
   marked already-resolved/done (e.g. P0.2, P4's "already resolved" note).
2. **Build it.** Implement against the verification rules in §0. Extend the
   existing stdlib `unittest` suite for anything touching `app/domain/`.
3. **Review it.** Before committing, dispatch the `code-reviewer` subagent
   (via the `Agent` tool) against your diff. If the task touched
   `app/core/secrets.py`, session/auth (`app/game/session.py`), or anything
   handling the game credentials, also dispatch `security-reviewer`. Address
   what comes back — don't commit past a real finding without either fixing it
   or writing down why it doesn't apply.
4. **Test it.** `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v` must pass in
   full, not just the new test. Fix or revert before moving on if it doesn't.
5. **Log code quality.** Append an entry to `docs/CODE_QUALITY_NOTES.md`
   (create it if missing; **append**, never overwrite prior entries) for every
   module you touched or read closely this task:

   ```
   ## <module path> — reviewed <YYYY-MM-DD>, TODO <item #>
   - Stability (1-5): X — <works as-is? crashes on edge cases? provisional/unverified?>
   - Expandability (1-5): X — <easy to extend with a new mode/vehicle class/endpoint?>
   - Maintainability (1-5): X — <readability, coupling, test coverage, comment quality>
   - Verdict: keep-as-is / refactor-in-place / rebuild-candidate
   - Rationale: <1-3 sentences, concrete, not diplomatic>
   ```

6. **Commit.** One task = one commit (or a few tightly-scoped ones). Reference
   the TODO item in the message (e.g. `P1.3: subtract en-route for shared
   missions`).
7. **Check the box in `TODO.md`** for the item you just finished, and update
   any doc TODO.md tells you to update for that item (e.g. P2's task asks you
   to update `docs/MODES-TODO.md`'s decisions log — do that as part of the
   same commit).
8. **Go to step 1.**

If a task requires a product decision only Sasha can make (flagged as such in
TODO.md — e.g. P3.3's per-member-vs-group-wide question, or P2's
parasite+patient combo policy), don't guess: log it below and either wait for
an answer before continuing that item, or skip to the next task and come back.

---

## 2. Blocked — needs Sasha

Running log. Add an entry every time step 1's verification order dead-ends or
a task needs a product decision. Don't delete entries — mark them resolved
inline once Sasha answers.

```
- [ ] <TODO item #> — <what's blocked and what's needed from Sasha>
```

(Empty until the session hits its first blocker.)

---

## 3. Scope reminders

- Estate/building automation is **removed on purpose** (Sasha has his own
  script) — don't resurrect `layout.py`/`estate.py`/`crew.py`/`reconcile.py`/
  `training.py`/`executor.py`/`writes.py`. If you notice `README.md` still
  describes them as built, that's a known stale-doc issue — leave a one-line
  note in your session summary but don't fix it mid-run (separate task).
- Don't touch the P4 "already resolved" items listed in `TODO.md`
  (`additive_overlays`, `participating` semantics, FMS-5 cadence) — they're
  done, not open work.

---

## 4. End of session

When every P0–P4 item is either checked off or logged as blocked in §2,
summarize: what shipped (with commit refs), what's blocked and on what,
and a rollup of the `docs/CODE_QUALITY_NOTES.md` verdicts — which modules are
trending toward rebuild-candidate vs. holding up fine. Don't push/merge
without asking first.
